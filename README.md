These are easy to understand code made for you to easily implement in practicals. 
So don't be a crybaby and complain about its optimization/time-complexity
Lastly, Don't ask me to explain the code because:
  1>These codes are self explainatory
  2>You are now mature enough to understand them on your own
  3>I have other work to do as well
